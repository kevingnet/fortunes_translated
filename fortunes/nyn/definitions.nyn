cerebral atrophy, n:	The phenomena which occurs as brain cells become weak and sick, andimpair the brain's performance.

A certain small number of brain cells will deteriorate due toeverday activity, but large amounts are weakened by intense mental effortand the assimilation of difficult concepts.  Many college students becomevictims of this dread disorder due to poor habits such as overstudying.cerebral darwinism, n:	The theory that the effects of cerebral atrophy can be reversedthrough the purging action of heavy alcohol consumption.  Large amounts ofalcohol cause many brain cells to perish due to oxygen deprivation.  Throughthe process of natural selection, the weak and sick brain cells will diefirst, leaving only the healthy cells.  This wonderful process leaves theimbiber with a healthier, more vibrant brain, and increases mental capacity.Thus, the devastating effects of cerebral atrophy are reversed, and academicperformance actually increases beyond previous levels.

Every Horse has an Infinite Number of Legs (proof by intimidation):Horses have an even number of legs.  Behind they have two legs, and infront they have fore-legs.  This makes six legs, which is certainly anodd number of legs for a horse.  But the only number that is both evenand odd is infinity.  Therefore, horses have an infinite number oflegs.  Now to show this for the general case, suppose that somewhere,there is a horse that has a finite number of legs.  But that is a horseof another color, and by the lemma ["All horses are the same color"],that does not exist.

Fortune's Rules for Memo Wars: #2Given the incredible advances in sociocybernetics and telepsychology overthe last few years, we are now able to completely understand everything thatthe author of an memo is trying to say.  Thanks to modern developmentsin electrocommunications like notes, vnews, and electricity, we have anincredible level of interunderstanding the likes of which civilization hasnever known.  Thus, the possibility of your misinterpreting someone else'smemo is practically nil.  Knowing this, anyone who accuses you of havingdone so is a liar, and should be treated accordingly.  If you *do* understandthe memo in question, but have absolutely nothing of substance to say, thenyou have an excellent opportunity for a vicious ad hominem attack.  In fact,the only *inappropriate* times for an ad hominem attack are as follows:	1: When you agree completely with the author of an memo.	2: When the author of the original memo is much bigger than you are.	3: When replying to one of your own memos.

Frobnicate, v.:	To manipulate or adjust, to tweak.  Derived from FROBNITZ. Usuallyabbreviated to FROB.  Thus one has the saying "to frob a frob." See TWEAKand TWIDDLE.  Usage: FROB, TWIDDLE, and TWEAK sometimes connote points alonga continuum.  FROB connotes aimless manipulation; TWIDDLE connotes grossmanipulation, often a coarse search for a proper setting; TWEAK connotesfine-tuning.  If someone is turning a knob on an oscilloscope, then if he'scarefully adjusting it he is probably tweaking it; if he is just turning itbut looking at the screen he is probably twiddling it; but if he's justdoing it because turning a knob is fun, he's frobbing it.

Lemma:  All horses are the same color.Proof (by induction):	Case n = 1: In a set with only one horse, it is obvious that all	horses in that set are the same color.	Case n = k: Suppose you have a set of k+1 horses.  Pull one of these	horses out of the set, so that you have k horses.  Suppose that all	of these horses are the same color.  Now put back the horse that you	took out, and pull out a different one.  Suppose that all of the k	horses now in the set are the same color.  Then the set of k+1 horses	are all the same color.  We have k true => k+1 true; therefore all	horses are the same color.Theorem: All horses have an infinite number of legs.Proof (by intimidation):	Everyone would agree that all horses have an even number of legs.  It	is also well-known that horses have forelegs in front and two legs in	back.  4 + 2 = 6 legs, which is certainly an odd number of legs for a	horse to have!  Now the only number that is both even and odd is	infinity; therefore all horses have an infinite number of legs.	However, suppose that there is a horse somewhere that does not have an	infinite number of legs.  Well, that would be a horse of a different	color; and by the Lemma, it doesn't exist.

Theorem: All positive integers are equal.Proof: Sufficient to show that for any two positive integers, A and B, A = B.	Further, it is sufficient to show that for all N > 0, if A and B	(positive integers) satisfy (MAX(A, B) = N) then A = B.Proceed by induction:	If N = 1, then A and B, being positive integers, must both be 1.	So A = B.Assume that the theorem is true for some value k.  Take A and B with	MAX(A, B) = k+1.  Then  MAX((A-1), (B-1)) = k.  And hence	(A-1) = (B-1).  Consequently, A = B.

		William Safire's Rules for Writers:Remember to never split an infinitive.  The passive voice should never beused.  Do not put statements in the negative form.  Verbs have to agree withtheir subjects.  Proofread carefully to see if you words out.  If you rereadyour work, you can find on rereading a great deal of repetition can beavoided by rereading and editing.  A writer must not shift your point ofview.  And don't start a sentence with a conjunction.  (Remember, too, apreposition is a terrible word to end a sentence with.) Don't overuseexclamation marks!!  Place pronouns as close as possible, especially in longsentences, as of 10 or more words, to their antecedents.  Writing carefully,dangling participles must be avoided.  If any word is improper at the end ofa sentence, a linking verb is.  Take the bull by the hand and avoid mixingmetaphors.  Avoid trendy locutions that sound flaky.  Everyone should becareful to use a singular pronoun with singular nouns in their writing.Always pick on the correct idiom.  The adverb always follows the verb.  Lastbut not least, avoid cliches like the plague; seek viable alternatives.
