A sharper perspective on this matter is particularly important to feministthought today, because a major tendency in feminism has constructed theproblem of domination as a drama of female vulnerability victimized by maleaggression.  Even the more sophisticated feminist thinkers frequently shyaway from the analysis of submission, for fear that in admitting woman'sparticipation in the relationship of domination, the onus of responsibilitywill appear to shift from men to women, and the moral victory from women tomen.  More generally, this has been a weakness of radical politics: toidealize the oppressed, as if their politics and culture were untouched bythe system of domination, as if people did not participate in their ownsubmission.  To reduce domination to a simple relation of doer and done-tois to substitute moral outrage for analysis.

A sociologist, a psychologist, and a engineer were discussing theconsequences and implications of a married man's having a mistress.  Thesociologist's opinion was that it is absolutely and categorically unforgivablefor a married man to forfeit the bond of matrimony, and engage in such lowlyand lustful pursuits.	The psychologist's opinion was that although morally reprehensible,if a man MUST have a mistress to achieve his full potential as a human being,then -- well -- he may go ahead and choose to have a mistress, as long as heis considerate enough to keep this secret from his wife.	The engineer then interjected: "I also believe that, if necessary,a married man is entitled to a mistress.  However, I do not see why theaffair should be concealed from the wife.  On the contrary, if the affairis out in the open, then on Friday evenings he may tell his wife that heis going to see his mistress, tell his mistress that he is going to be withhis wife, then go to his office and get some work done!"

American culture is based on the automobile, and any young man of promiseis going to own one and want to travel great distances in it.  Consequently,any young woman of aspiration should expect to spend most of her vacationsin a car, probing into unfamiliar corners.  She is not required to know howto drive but she will certainly be expected to read the road map while herhusband drives, and if she can't, or if she's abnormally slow in giving himhelp, she's bound to cause trouble.  Therefore, you'd think that collegeswhich train the bright young women who're going to marry the bright youngmen who are going to own the Cadillacs that roar back and forth across thiscontinent would teach the girls to read maps.  None do. They teach a hundredother useless things, but never a word about the one that will cause thegreatest friction.

She chewed a rare brand of plug called Stuff It, which shelearned to chew when she was playing Nicaraguan summer ball.

FORTUNE DISCUSSES THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN MEN AND WOMEN:	#14Low Blows:	Let's say a man and woman are watching a boxing match on TV.  Oneof the boxers is felled by a low blow.  The woman says "Oh, gee.  That musthurt." The man doubles over and actually FEELS the pain.Dressing Up:	A woman will dress up to go shopping, water the plants, empty thegarbage, answer the phone, read a book, get the mail.   A man will dress upfor: weddings, funerals.  Speaking of weddings, when reminiscing aboutweddings, women talk about "the ceremony".  Men laugh about "the bachelorparty".David Letterman:	Men think David Letterman is the funniest man on the face of theEarth.  Women think he is a mean, semi-dorky guy who always has a bad haircut.

FORTUNE DISCUSSES THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN MEN AND WOMEN:	#16Relationships:	First of all, a man does not call a relationship a relationship -- herefers to it as "that time when me and Suzie were doing it on a semi-regularbasis".	When a relationship ends, a woman will cry and pour her heart out toher girlfriends, and she will write a poem titled "All Men Are Idiots".  Thenshe will get on with her life.	A man has a little more trouble letting go.  Six months after thebreakup, at 3:00 a.m. on a Saturday night, he will call and say, "I justwanted to let you know you ruined my life, and I'll never forgive you, and Ihate you, and you're a total floozy.  But I want you to know that there'salways a chance for us".  This is known as the "I Hate You / I Love You"drunken phone call, that 99% if all men have made at least once.  There arecommunity colleges that offer courses to help men get over this need; alas,these classes rarely prove effective.

The average woman has shoes 4 layers thick on the floorof her closet.  Most of them hurt her feet.Making friends:	 A woman will meet another woman with common interests, do a few thingstogether, and say something like, "I hope we can be good friends."	A man will meet another man with common interests, do a few thingstogether, and say nothing.  After years of interacting with this other man,sharing hopes and fears that he wouldn't confide in his priest orpsychiatrist, he'll finally let down his guard in a fit of drunkensentimentality and say something like, "You know, for someone who's such ajerk, I guess you're OK."

He will work on a problemhimself until it either goes away or turns into something that "can't befixed without special tools".	The average woman thinks "that funny thump-thump noise" is anaccurate description of an automotive problem.

A man will let new shirts sit onthe shelf in their original packaging for a couple of years before puttingthem to use, hoping they'll become more comfortable with age.

The average man won't say anything if he knows thatone of his friend's mates is fooling around, and he'd rather not know ifhis mate is having an affair either, out of fear that it might be with oneof his friends.  He will tell all his friends about his own affairs, though,so they can be ready if he needs an alibi.Driving:	A typical man thinks he's Mario Andretti as soon as he slips behindthe wheel of his car.  The fact that it's an 8-year-old Honda doesn't keephim from trying to out-accelerate the guy in the Porsche who's attemptingto cut him off; freeway on-ramps are exciting challenges to see who has TheRight Stuff on the morning commute.  Does he or doesn't he?  Only his bodyshop knows for sure.  Insurance companies understand this behavior, andprice their policies accordingly.

Men are amused by almost any idiot thing -- that is why professional icehockey is so popular -- so buying gifts for them is easy.  But you shouldnever buy them clothes.  Men believe they already have all the clothes theywill ever need, and new ones make them nervous.  For example, your averageman has 84 ties, but he wears, at most, only three of them.  He has learned,through humiliating trial and error, that if he wears any of the other 81ties, his wife will probably laugh at him ("You're not going to wear THATtie with that suit, are you?"). So he has narrowed it down to three safeties, and has gone several years without being laughed at.  If you give hima new tie, he will pretend to like it, but deep inside he will hate you.If you want to give a man something practical, consider tires.  More thanonce, I would have gladly traded all the gifts I got for a new set of tires.

I began many years ago, as so many young men do, in searching for theperfect woman.  I believed that if I looked long enough, and hard enough,I would find her and then I would be secure for life.  Well, the yearsand romances came and went, and I eventually ended up settling for someonea lot less than my idea of perfection.  But one day, after many yearstogether, I lay there on our bed recovering from a slight illness.  Mywife was sitting on a chair next to the bed, humming softly and watchingthe late afternoon sun filtering through the trees.  The only sounds tobe heard elsewhere were the clock ticking, the kettle downstairs startingto boil, and an occasional schoolchild passing beneath our window.  Andas I looked up into my wife's now wrinkled face, but still warm andtwinkling eyes, I realized something about perfection...  It comes onlywith time.

	It is always preferable to visit home with a friend.  Your parents willnot be pleased with this plan, because they want you all to themselves andbecause in the presence of your friend, they will have to act like maturehuman beings.	The worst kind of friend to take home is a girl, because in that case,there is the potential that your parents will lose you not just for theduration of the visit but forever.  The worst kind of girl to take home is oneof a different religion:  Not only will you be lost to your parents forever butyou will be lost to a woman who is immune to their religious/moral argumentsand whose example will irretrievably corrupt you.	Let's say you've fallen in love with just such a girl and would liketo take her home for the holidays.  You are aware of your parents' xenophobicresponse to anyone of a different religion.  How to prepare them for the shock?	Simple.  Call them up shortly before your visit and tell them that youhave gotten quite serious about somebody who is of a different religion, adifferent race and the same sex.  Tell them you have already invited thisperson to meet them.  Give the information a moment to sink in and thenremark that you were only kidding, that your lover is merely of a differentreligion.

Shedoes not want you to call attention to this by saying, 'If you wanted adessert, why didn't you order one?'  You must understand, she has thedessert she wants.  The dessert she wants is contained within yours.

It was raining heavily, and the motorist had car trouble on a lonely countryroad.  Anxious to find shelter for the night, he walked over to a farmhouseand knocked on the front door.  No one responded.  He could feel the waterfrom the roof running down the back of his neck as he stood on the stoop.The next time he knocked louder, but still no answer.  By now he was soakedto the skin.  Desperately he pounded on the door.  At last the head of aman appeared out of an upstairs window.	"What do you want?" he asked gruffly.	"My car broke down," said the traveler, "and I want to know if youwould let me stay here for the night."	"Sure," replied the man. "If you want to stay there all night, it'sokay with me."

	Once upon a time there was a beautiful young girl taking a strollthrough the woods.  All at once she saw an extremely ugly bull frog seatedon a log and to her amazement the frog spoke to her.  "Maiden," croaked thefrog, "would you do me a favor?  This will be hard for you to believe, butI was once a handsome, charming prince and then a mean, ugly old witch casta spell over me and turned me into a frog."	"Oh, what a pity!", exclaimed the girl.  "I'll do anything I can tohelp you break such a spell."	"Well," replied the frog, "the only way that this spell can betaken away is for some lovely young woman to take me home and let me spendthe night under her pillow."	The young girl took the ugly frog home and placed him beneath herpillow that night when she retired.  When she awoke the next morning, sureenough, there beside her in bed was a very young, handsome man, clearly ofroyal blood.  And so they lived happily ever after, except that to this dayher father and mother still don't believe her story.

Well, one day, in full armour, their horses,and their page, the three brothers set off to see if one of them couldwin her hand.  The road was long and there were many obstacles along theway, robbers to be overcome, hard terrain to cross.  As they coped witheach obstacle they became more and more disgusted with their page.  He wasnot only inept, he was a coward, he could not handle the horses, he was,in short, a complete flop.  When they arrived at the court of the kingdom,they found that they were expected to present the Princess with sometreasure.  The two older brothers were discouraged, since they had notthought of this and were unprepared.  The youngest, however, had theanswer:  Promise her anything, but give her our page.

	People of all sorts of genders are reporting great difficulty,these days, in selecting the proper words to refer to those of the femalepersuasion.	"Lady," "woman," and "girl" are all perfectly good words, butmisapplying them can earn one anything from the charge of vulgarity to a goodswift smack.  We are messing here with matters of deference, condescension,respect, bigotry, and two vague concepts, age and rank.  It is troublingenough to get straight who is really what.  Those who deliberately misusethe terms in a misbegotten attempt at flattery are asking for it.	A woman is any grown-up female person.  A girl is the un-grown-upversion.  If you call a wee thing with chubby cheeks and pink hair ribbons a"woman," you will probably not get into trouble, and if you do, you will beable to handle it because she will be under three feet tall.  However, if youcall a grown-up by a child's name for the sake of implying that she has ayouthful body, you are also implying that she has a brain to match.

	Young men and young women may work systematically six days in theweek and rise fresh in the morning, but let them attend modern dances foronly a few hours each evening and see what happens.  The Waltz, Polka,Gallop and other dances of the same kind will be disastrous in their effectsto both sexes.  Health and vigor will vanish like the dew before the sun.	It is not the extraordinary exercise which harms the dancer, butrather the coming into close contact with the opposite sex.  It is thefury of lust craving incessantly for more pleasure that undermines thesoul, the body, the sinews and nerves.  Experience and statistics showbeyond doubt that passionate excessive dancing girls can hardly reachtwenty-five years of age and men thirty-one.  Even if they reached thatage they will in most instances be broken in health physically and morally.This is the claim of prominent physicians in this country.
