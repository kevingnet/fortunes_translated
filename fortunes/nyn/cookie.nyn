At the heart of science is an essential tension between two seeminglycontradictory attitudes -- an openness to new ideas, no matter how bizarreor counterintuitive they may be, and the most ruthless skeptical scrutinyof all ideas, old and new.  This is how deep truths are winnowed from deepnonsense.  Of course, scientists make mistakes in trying to understand theworld, but there is a built-in error-correcting mechanism:  The collectiveenterprise of creative thinking and skeptical thinking together keeps thefield on track.

Each team building another component has been using the most recent testedversion of the integrated system as a test bed for debugging its piece.

It is a very humbling experience to make a multimillion-dollar mistake, but itis also very memorable.  I vividly recall the night we decided how to organizethe actual writing of external specifications for OS/360.  The manager ofarchitecture, the manager of control program implementation, and I werethreshing out the plan, schedule, and division of responsibilities.The architecture manager had 10 good men.  He asserted that they could writethe specifications and do it right.  It would take ten months, three morethan the schedule allowed.The control program manager had 150 men.  He asserted that they could preparethe specifications, with the architecture team coordinating; it would bewell-done and practical, and he could do it on schedule.  Furthermore, ifthe architecture team did it, his 150 men would sit twiddling their thumbsfor ten months.To this the architecture manager responded that if I gave the control programteam the responsibility, the result would not in fact be on time, but wouldalso be three months late, and of much lower quality.  I did, and it was.  Hewas right on both counts.  Moreover, the lack of conceptual integrity madethe system far more costly to build and change, and I would estimate that itadded a year to debugging time.

Overall, the philosophy is to attack the availability problem from twocomplementary directions:  to reduce the number of software errors throughrigorous testing of running systems, and to reduce the effect of theremaining errors by providing for recovery from them.  An interesting footnoteto this design is that now a system failure can usually be considered to bethe result of two program errors:  the first, in the program that started theproblem; the second, in the recovery routine that could not protect thesystem.  -- A.

I believe that part of what propels science is the thirst for wonder.  It's avery powerful emotion.  All children feel it.  In a first grade classroomeverybody feels it; in a twelfth grade classroom almost nobody feels it, orat least acknowledges it.  Something happens between first and twelfth grade,and it's not just puberty.  Not only do the schools and the media not teachmuch skepticism, there is also little encouragement of this stirring senseof wonder.  Science and pseudoscience both arouse that feeling.  Poorpopularizations of science establish an ecological niche for pseudoscience.

If science were explained to the average person in a way that is accessibleand exciting, there would be no room for pseudoscience.  But there is a kindof Gresham's Law by which in popular culture the bad science drives out thegood.  And for this I think we have to blame, first, the scientific communityourselves for not doing a better job of popularizing science, and second, themedia, which are in this respect almost uniformly dreadful.  Every newspaperin America has a daily astrology column.  How many have even a weeklyastronomy column?  And I believe it is also the fault of the educationalsystem.  We do not teach how to think.  This is a very serious failure thatmay even, in a world rigged with 60,000 nuclear weapons, compromise the humanfuture.

Deliberate provocation of mystical experience, particularly by LSD and relatedhallucinogens, in contrast to spontaneous visionary experiences, entailsdangers that must not be underestimated.  Practitioners must take intoaccount the peculiar effects of these substances, namely their ability toinfluence our consciousness, the innermost essence of our being.  The historyof LSD to date amply demonstrates the catastrophic consequences that canensue when its profound effect is misjudged and the substance is mistakenfor a pleasure drug.  Special internal and external advance preparationsare required; with them, an LSD experiment can become a meaningfulexperience.

...Another writer again agreed with all my generalities, but said that as aninveterate skeptic I have closed my mind to the truth.  Most notably I haveignored the evidence for an Earth that is six thousand years old.  Well, Ihaven't ignored it; I considered the purported evidence and *then* rejected it.There is a difference, and this is a difference, we might say, betweenprejudice and postjudice.  Prejudice is making a judgment before you havelooked at the facts.  Postjudice is making a judgment afterwards.  Prejudiceis terrible, in the sense that you commit injustices and you make seriousmistakes.  Postjudice is not terrible.  You can't be perfect of course; youmay make mistakes also.  But it is permissible to make a judgment after youhave examined the evidence.  In some circles it is even encouraged.

"...stupid creatures unworthy of the name `sophonts.'  Foolish, pre-sentientupspring of errant masters.  We slip away from all your armed might, laughingat your clumsiness!  We slip away as we always will, you pathetic creatures.And now that we have a real head start, you'll never catch us!  What betterproof that the Progenitors favor not you, but us!  What better proof..."   The taunt went on.  Krat listened, enraged, yet at the same time savoringthe artistry of it.  These men are better than I'd thought.  Their insultsare wordy and overblown, but they have talent.  They deserve honorable, slowdeaths.

Modern psychology takes completely for granted that behavior and neural functionare perfectly correlated, that one is completely caused by the other.  There isno separate soul or lifeforce to stick a finger into the brain now and then andmake neural cells do what they would not otherwise.  Actually, of course, thisis a working assumption only....It is quite conceivable that someday theassumption will have to be rejected.  But it is important also to see that wehave not reached that day yet: the working assumption is a necessary one andthere is no real evidence opposed to it.  Our failure to solve a problem sofar does not make it insoluble.  One cannot logically be a determinist inphysics and biology, and a mystic in psychology.

The more a man is imbued with the ordered regularity of all events, the firmerbecomes his conviction that there is no room left by the side of this orderedregularity for causes of a different nature.  For him neither the rule ofhuman nor the rule of divine will exists as an independent cause of naturalevents.  To be sure, the doctrine of a personal God interfering with naturalevents could never be refuted, in the real sense, by science, for thisdoctrine can always take refuge in those domains in which scientific knowledgehas not yet been able to set foot.But I am persuaded that such behavior on the part of the representativesof religion would not only be unworthy but also fatal.  For a doctrine whichis able to maintain itself not in clear light, but only in the dark, willof necessity lose its effect on mankind, with incalculable harm to humanprogress.  In their struggle for the ethical good, teachers of religionmust have the stature to give up the doctrine of a personal God, that is,give up that source of fear and hope which in the past placed such vastpowers in the hands of priests.  In their labors they will have to availthemselves of those forces which are capable of cultivating the Good, theTrue, and the Beautiful in humanity itself.  This is, to be sure, a moredifficult but an incomparably more worthy task.

However, on religious issues there can be little or no compromise.There is no position on which people are so immovable as their religiousbeliefs.  There is no more powerful ally one can claim in a debate thanJesus Christ, or God, or Allah, or whatever one calls this supreme being.But like any powerful weapon, the use of God's name on one's behalfshould be used sparingly.  The religious factions that are growingthroughout our land are not using their religious clout with wisdom.They are trying to force government leaders into following their position100 percent.  If you disagree with these religious groups on aparticular moral issue, they complain, they threaten you with a loss ofmoney or votes or both.

...And no philosophy, sadly, has all the answers.  No matter how assuredwe may be about certain aspects of our belief, there are always painfulinconsistencies, exceptions, and contradictions.  This is true in religion asit is in politics, and is self-evident to all except fanatics and the naive.As for the fanatics, whose number is legion in our own time, we might beadvised to leave them to heaven.  They will not, unfortunately, do us thesame courtesy.  They attack us and each other, and whatever theirprotestations to peaceful intent, the bloody record of history makes clearthat they are easily disposed to restore to the sword.  My own belief inGod, then, is just that -- a matter of belief, not knowledge.  My respectfor Jesus Christ arises from the fact that He seems to have been themost virtuous inhabitant of Planet Earth.  But even well-educated Christiansare frustrated in their thirst for certainty about the beloved figureof Jesus because of the undeniable ambiguity of the scriptural record.Such ambiguity is not apparent to children or fanatics, but everyrecognized Bible scholar is perfectly aware of it.

Already the spirit of our schooling is permeated with the feeling thatevery subject, every topic, every fact, every professed truth must besubmitted to a certain publicity and impartiality.  All profferedsamples of learning must go to the same assay-room and be subjected tocommon tests.  It is the essence of all dogmatic faiths to hold thatany such "show-down" is sacrilegious and perverse.  The characteristicof religion, from their point of view, is that it is intellectuallysecret, not public; peculiarly revealed, not generally known;authoritatively declared, not communicated and tested in ordinaryways...It is pertinent to point out that, as long as religion isconceived as it is now by the great majority of professed religionists,there is something self-contradictory in speaking of education inreligion in the same sense in which we speak of education in topicswhere the method of free inquiry has made its way.  The "religious"would be the last to be willing that either the history of thecontent of religion should be taught in this spirit; while thoseto whom the scientific standpoint is not merely a technical device,but is the embodiment of the integrity of mind, must protest againstits being taught in any other spirit.- John Dewey (1859-1953), American philosopher,  from "Democracy in the Schools", 1908

The Middle East is certainly the nexus of turmoil for a long time to come --with shifting players, but the same game: upheaval.

...One thing is that, unlike any other Western democracy that I know of,this country has operated since its beginnings with a basic distrust ofgovernment.  We are constituted not for efficient operation of government,but for minimizing the possibility of abuse of power.  It took the eventsof the Roosevelt era -- a catastrophic economic collapse and a world war --to introduce the strong central government that we now know.  But in mostparts of the country today, the reluctance to have government is stillstrong.  I think, barring a series of catastrophic events, that we canlook to at least another decade during which many of the big problemsaround this country will have to be addressed by institutions other thanfederal government.- Bobby R.

While it cannot be proved retrospectively that any experience of possession,conversion, revelation, or divine ecstasy was merely an epileptic discharge,we must ask how one differentiates "real transcendence" from neuropathiesthat produce the same extreme realness, profundity, ineffability, and senseof cosmic unity.  When accounts of sudden religious conversions in TLEs[temporal-lobe epileptics] are laid alongside the epiphanous revelations ofthe religious tradition, the parallels are striking.  The same is true of therecent spate of alleged UFO abductees.  Parsimony alone argues against invokingspirits, demons, or extraterrestrials when natural causes will suffice.-- Barry L.

Two things are certain about science.  It does not stand still for long,and it is never boring.  Oh, among some poor souls, including evenintellectuals in fields of high scholarship, science is frequentlymisperceived.  Many see it as only a body of facts, promulgated fromon high in must, unintelligible textbooks, a collection of unchangingprecepts defended with authoritarian vigor.  Others view it as nothingbut a cold, dry narrow, plodding, rule-bound process -- the scientificmethod: hidebound, linear, and left brained.These people are the victims of their own stereotypes.  They aredestined to view the world of science with a set of blinders.  Theyknow nothing of the tumult, cacophony, rambunctiousness, andtendentiousness of the actual scientific process, let alone thecreativity, passion, and joy of discovery.  And they are likely toknow little of the continual procession of new insights and discoveriesthat every day, in some way, change our view (if not theirs) of thenatural world.-- Kendrick Frazier, "The Year in Science: An Overview," in   1988 Yearbook of Science and the Future, Encyclopaedia Britannica, Inc.

I did cancel one performance in Holland where they thought my music was so easythat they didn't rehearse at all.  And so the first time when I found that out,I rehearsed the orchestra myself in front of the audience of 3,000 people andthe next day I rehearsed through the second movement -- this was the piece_Cheap Imitation_ -- and they then were ashamed.  The Dutch people were ashamedand they invited me to come to the Holland festival and they promised torehearse.  And when I got to Amsterdam they had changed the orchestra, andagain, they hadn't rehearsed.  So they were no more prepared the second timethan they had been the first.  I gave them a lecture and told them to cancelthe performance; they then said over the radio that i had insisted on theircancelling the performance because they were "insufficiently Zen."Can you believe it?

"In corporate life, I think there are three important areas which contractscan't deal with, the area of conflict, the area of change and area of reachingpotential.  To me a covenant is a relationship that is based on such thingsas shared ideals and shared value systems and shared ideas and sharedagreement as to the processes we are going to use for working together.  Inmany cases they develop into real love relationships."-- Max DePree, chairman and CEO of Herman Miller Inc., "Herman Miller's   Secrets of Corporate Creativity", The Wall Street Journal, May 3, 1988

Another goal is to establish a relationship "in which it is OK for everybodyto do their best.

In his book, Mr. DePree tells the story of how designer George Nelson urgedthat the company also take on Charles Eames in the late 1940s.  Max's father,J. DePree, co-founder of the company with Herman Miller in 1923, asked Mr.Nelson if he really wanted to share the limited opportunities of a then-smallcompany with another designer.  "George's response was something like this:'Charles Eames is an unusual talent.  He is very different from me.  Thecompany needs us both.  I want very much to have Charles Eames share inwhatever potential there is.'"-- Max DePree, chairman and CEO of Herman Miller Inc., "Herman Miller's   Secrets of Corporate Creativity", The Wall Street Journal, May 3, 1988

Mr. DePree believes participative capitalism is the wave of the future.  TheU.S. work force, he believes, "more and more demands to be included in thecapitalist system and if we don't find ways to get the capitalist systemto be an inclusive system rather than the exclusive system it has been, we'reall in deep trouble.  If we don't find ways to begin to understand thatcapitalism's highest potential lies in the common good, not in the individualgood, then we're risking the system itself."-- Max DePree, chairman and CEO of Herman Miller Inc., "Herman Miller's   Secrets of Corporate Creativity", The Wall Street Journal, May 3, 1988

Mr. DePree also expects a "tremendous social change" in all workplaces.  "WhenI first started working 40 years ago, a factory supervisor was focused on theproduct.  Today it is drastically different, because of the social milieu.It isn't unusual for a worker to arrive on his shift and have some familyproblem that he doesn't know how to resolve.  The example I like to use is aguy who comes in and says 'this isn't going to be a good day for me, my sonis in jail on a drunk-driving charge and I don't know how to raise bail.'What that means is that if the supervisor wants productivity, he has to knowhow to raise bail."-- Max DePree, chairman and CEO of Herman Miller Inc., "Herman Miller's   Secrets of Corporate Creativity", The Wall Street Journal, May 3, 1988

"The stars are made of the same atoms as the earth."  I usually pick one smalltopic like this to give a lecture on.  Poets say science takes away from thebeauty of the stars -- mere gobs of gas atoms.  Nothing is "mere."  I too cansee the stars on a desert night, and feel them.  But do I see less or more?The vastness of the heavens stretches my imagination -- stuck on this carouselmy little eye can catch one-million-year-old light.  A vast pattern -- of whichI am a part -- perhaps my stuff was belched from some forgotten star, as oneis belching there.  Or see them with the greater eye of Palomar, rushing allapart from some common starting point when they were perhaps all together.What is the pattern, or the meaning, or the *why?*  It does not do harm to themystery to know a little about it.  For far more marvelous is the truth thanany artists of the past imagined!  Why do the poets of the present not speakof it?

"Pseudocode can be used to some extent to aid the maintenanceprocess.  However, pseudocode that is highly detailed -approaching the level of detail of the code itself - is not ofmuch use as maintenance documentation.  Such detaileddocumentation has to be maintained almost as much as the code,thus doubling the maintenance burden.  Furthermore, since suchvoluminous pseudocode is too distracting to be kept in thelisting itself, it must be kept in a separate folder.  Theresult: Since pseudocode - unlike real code - doesn't have to bemaintained, no one will maintain it.  It will soon become out ofdate and everyone will ignore it.

An Animal that knows who it is, one that has a sense of his own identity, isa discontented creature, doomed to create new problems for himself for theduration of his stay on this planet.  Since neither the mouse nor the chimpknows what is, he is spared all the vexing problems that follow thisdiscovery.  But as soon as the human animal who asked himself this questionemerged, he plunged himself and his descendants into an eternity of doubtand brooding, speculation and truth-seeking that has goaded him through thecenturies as relentlessly as hunger or sexual longing.  The chimp that doesnot know that he exists is not driven to discover his origins and is sparedthe tragic necessity of contemplating his own end.  And even if the animalexperimenters succeed in teaching a chimp to count one hundred bananas orto play chess, the chimp will develop no science and he will exhibit noappreciation of beauty, for the greatest part of man's wisdom may be tracedback to the eternal questions of beginnings and endings, the quest to givemeaning to his existence, to life itself.

    UNIX Shell is the Best Fourth Generation Programming Language    It is the UNIX shell that makes it possible to do applications in a small    fraction of the code and time it takes in third generation languages.  In    the shell you process whole files at a time, instead of only a line at a    time.  And, a line of code in the UNIX shell is one or more programs,    which do more than pages of instructions in a 3GL.  Applications can be    developed in hours and days, rather than months and years with traditional    systems.  Most of the other 4GLs available today look more like COBOL or    RPG, the most tedious of the third generation languages."UNIX Relational Database Management:  Application Development in the UNIX Environment" by Rod Manis, Evan Schaffer, and Robert Jorgensen.

"A commercial, and in some respects a social, doubt has been started within the last year or two, whether or not it is right to discuss so openly the security or insecurity of locks.  Many well-meaning persons suppose that the discus- sion respecting the means for baffling the supposed safety of locks offers a premium for dishonesty, by showing others how to be dishonest.  This is a fal- lacy.  Rogues are very keen in their profession, and already know much more than we can teach them respecting their several kinds of roguery.  Rogues knew a good deal about lockpicking long before locksmiths discussed it among them- selves, as they have lately done.  If a lock -- let it have been made in what- ever country, or by whatever maker -- is not so inviolable as it has hitherto been deemed to be, surely it is in the interest of *honest* persons to know this fact, because the *dishonest* are tolerably certain to be the first to apply the knowledge practically; and the spread of knowledge is necessary to give fair play to those who might suffer by ignorance.  It cannot be too ear- nestly urged, that an acquaintance with real facts will, in the end, be better for all parties."-- Charles Tomlinson's Rudimentary Treatise on the Construction of Locks,   published around 1850

 In respect to lock-making, there can scarcely be such a thing as dishonesty of intention: the inventor produces a lock which he honestly thinks will possess such and such qualities; and he declares his belief to the world. If others differ from him in opinion concerning those qualities, it is open to them to say so; and the discussion, truthfully conducted, must lead to public advantage: the discussion stimulates curiosity, and curiosity stimu- lates invention.  Nothing but a partial and limited view of the question could lead to the opinion that harm can result: if there be harm, it will be much more than counterbalanced by good."-- Charles Tomlinson's Rudimentary Treatise on the Construction of Locks,   published around 1850.

First as to speech.  That privilege rests upon the premise thatthere is no proposition so uniformly acknowledged that it may not belawfully challenged, questioned, and debated.  It need not rest uponthe further premise that there are no propositions that are notopen to doubt; it is enough, even if there are, that in the end it isworse to suppress dissent than to run the risk of heresy.  Hence ithas been again and again unconditionally proclaimed that there areno limits to the privilege so far as words seek to affect only the hearers'beliefs and not their conduct.  The trouble is that conduct is almostalways based upon some belief, and that to change the hearer's beliefwill generally to some extent change his conduct, and may even evokeconduct that the law forbids.[cf.

Astrology is the sheerest hokum.  This pseudoscience has been around sincethe day of the Chaldeans and Babylonians.  It is as phony as numerology,phrenology, palmistry, alchemy, the reading of tea leaves, and the practiceof divination by the entrails of a goat.

A serious public debate about the validity of astrology?  A serious believerin the White House?  Two of them?  Give me a break.  What stifled my laughteris that the image fits.  Reagan has always exhibited a fey indifference towardscience.  Facts, like numbers, roll off his back.  And we've all come toaccept it.  This time it was stargazing that became a serious issue....Notthat long ago, it was Reagan's support of Creationism....Creationists actuallygot equal time with evolutionists.  The public was supposed to be open-mindedto the claims of paleontologists and fundamentalists, as if the two werescientific colleagues....It has been clear for a long time that the presidentis averse to science...In general, these attitudes fall onto friendly Americanturf....But at the outer edges, this skepticism about science easily turnsinto a kind of naive acceptance of nonscience, or even nonsense.  The samepeople who doubt experts can also believe any quackery, from the benefits oflaetrile to eye of newt to the movement of planets.

The spectacle of astrology in the White House -- the governing center ofthe world's greatest scientific and military power -- is so appalling thatit defies understanding and provides grounds for great fright.

[Astrology is] 100 percent hokum, Ted.  As a matter of fact, the first editionof the Encyclopaedia Britannica, written in 1771 -- 1771! -- said that thisbelief system is a subject long ago ridiculed and reviled.  We're dealing withbeliefs that go back to the ancient Babylonians.  There's nothing there....It sounds a lot like science, it sounds like astronomy.  It's got technicalterms.  It's got jargon.  It confuses the public....The astrologer is quiteglib, confuses the public, uses terms which come from science, come frommetaphysics, come from a host of fields, but they really mean nothing.  Thefact is that astrological beliefs go back at least 2,500 years.  Now thatshould be a sufficiently long time for astrologers to prove their case.  Theyhave not proved their case....It's just simply gibberish.  The fact is, there'sno theory for it, there are no observational data for it.  It's been testedand tested over the centuries.  Nobody's ever found any validity to it atall.  It is not even close to a science.  A science has to be repeatable, ithas to have a logical foundation, and it has to be potentially vulnerable --you test it.  And in that astrology is really quite something else.-- Astronomer Richard Berendzen, President, American University, on ABC    News "Nightline," May 3, 1988

With the news that Nancy Reagan has referred to an astrologer when planningher husband's schedule, and reports of Californians evacuating Los Angeleson the strength of a prediction from a sixteenth-century physician andastrologer Michel de Notredame, the image of the U.S. as a scientific andtechnological nation has taking a bit of a battering lately.  Sadly, suchhappenings cannot be dismissed as passing fancies.  They are manifestationsof a well-established "anti-science" tendency in the U.S. which, ultimately,could threaten the country's position as a technological power. . . .  Themanifest widespread desire to reject rationality and substitute a seriesof quasirandom beliefs in order to understand the universe does not augurwell for a nation deeply concerned about its ability to compete with itsindustrial equals.  To the degree that it reflects the thinking of asignificant section of the public, this point of view encourages ignoranceof and, indeed, contempt for science and for rational methods of approachingtruth. . . . It is becoming clear that if the U.S. does not pick itself upsoon and devote some effort to educating the young effectively, its hope ofmaintaining a semblance of leadership in the world may rest, paradoxically,with a new wave of technically interested and trained immigrants who do notsuffer from the anti-science disease rampant in an apparently decaying society.

So if this `cyberpunk' thing isjust a term of convenience, how can somebody sell out?  If cyberpunk is just aword we use to describe a particular style and imagery in sf, how can it bedead?  Where are the profound statements that the `Movement' is or was tryingto make?	I think most of us are interested in examining and discussing literary(and musical) works that possess a certain stylistic excellence and perhaps arather extreme perspective; this is what CP is all about, no?

Willy certainly addressed this idea in"Count Zero," with Katatonenkunst, the automatic box-maker and the girl'sobservation that the real art was the building of the machine itself,rather than its output.

It might be worth reflecting that this group was originally createdback in September of 1987 and has exchanged over 1200 messages.  Theoriginal announcement for the group called for an all inclusivediscussion ranging from the writings of Gibson and Vinge and movieslike Bladerunner to real world things like Brands' description of thework being done at the MIT Media Lab.  It was meant as a haven forpeople with vision of this scope.  If you want to create a haven forpeople with narrower visions, feel free.  But I feel sad for anyonewho thinks that alt.cyberpunk is such a monstrous group that it is indire need of being subdivided.  Heaven help them if they ever startreading comp.arch or rec.arts.sf-lovers.

As for the basic assumptions about individuality and self, this is the coreof what I like about cyberpunk. And it's the core of what I like about certainpre-gibson neophile techie SF writers that certain folks here like to putdown. Not everyone makes the same assumptions.

Trailing Edge Technologies is pleased to announce the followingTETflame programme:1) For a negotiated price (no quatloos accepted) one of our flaming   representatives will flame the living shit out of the poster of   your choice. The price is inversly proportional to how much of   an asshole the target it. We cannot be convinced to flame Dennis   Ritchie. Matt Crawford flames are free.2) For a negotiated price (same arrangement) the TETflame programme   is offering ``flame insurence''. Under this arrangement, if   one of our policy holders is flamed, we will cancel the offending   article and flame the flamer, to a crisp.3) The TETflame flaming representatives include: Richard Sexton, Oleg   Kisalev, Diane Holt, Trish O'Tauma, Dave Hill, Greg Nowak and our most   recent acquisition, Keith Doyle. But all he will do is put you in his   kill file. Weemba by special arrangement.

Next, his name is Polish sounding.  So post tosoc.culture.polish.  But that group doesn't exist, so cross-post tonews.groups suggesting it should be created.

		     THE "FUN WITH USENET" MANIFESTOVery little happens on Usenet without some sort of response from some otherreader.  Fun With Usenet postings are no exception.  Since there are some whomight question the rationale of some of the excerpts included therein, I havewritten up a list of guidelines that sum up the philosophy behind thesepostings.	One.  I never cut out words in the middle of a quote without a VERYgood reason, and I never cut them out without including ellipses.  Forinstance, "I am not a goob" might become "I am ... a goob", but that's toomundane to bother with.  "I'm flame proof" might (and has) become"I'm ...a... p...oof" but that's REALLY stretching it.	Two.  If I cut words off the beginning or end of a quote, I don'tput ellipses, but neither do I capitalize something that wasn't capitalizedbefore the cut. "I don't think that the Church of Ubizmo is a wonderfulplace" would turn into "the Church of Ubizmo is a wonderful place".  Imaginethe posting as a tape-recording of the poster's thoughts.  If I can setup the quote via fast-forwarding and stopping the tape, and without splicing,I don't put ellipses in.  And by the way, I love using this mechanism forturning things around.  If you think something stinks, say so - don't say youdon't think it's wonderful.   ...

There was, it appeared, a mysterious rite of initiation through which, inone way or another, almost every member of the team passed.  The term thatthe old hands used for this rite -- West invented the term, not the practice --was `signing up.'  By signing up for the project you agreed to do whateverwas necessary for success.  You agreed to forsake, if necessary, family,hobbies, and friends -- if you had any of these left (and you might not, ifyou had signed up too many times before).

I made it a rule to forbear all direct contradictions to the sentiments ofothers, and all positive assertion of my own.  I even forbade myself the useof every word or expression in the language that imported a fixed opinion,such as "certainly", "undoubtedly", etc.   I adopted instead of them "Iconceive", "I apprehend", or "I imagine" a thing to be so or so; or "so itappears to me at present".When another asserted something that I thought an error, I denied myself thepleasure of contradicting him abruptly, and of showing him immediately someabsurdity in his proposition.  In answering I began by observing that incertain cases or circumstances his opinion would be right, but in the presentcase there appeared or seemed to me some difference, etc.I soon found the advantage of this change in my manner; the conversations Iengaged in went on more pleasantly.  The modest way in which I proposed myopinions procured them a readier reception and less contradiction.  I hadless mortification when I was found to be in the wrong, and I more easilyprevailed with others to give up their mistakes and join with me when Ihappened to be in the right.

One of the major difficulties Trillian experienced in her relationship withZaphod was learning to distinguish between him pretending to be stupid justto get people off their guard, pretending to be stupid because he couldn'tbe bothered to think and wanted someone else to do it for him, pretendingto be so outrageously stupid to hide the fact that he actually didn't understandhat was going on, and really being genuinely stupid.  He was reknowned forbeing quite clever and quite clearly was so -- but not all the time, whichobviously worried him, hence the act.  He preferred people to be puzzledrather than contemptuous.  This above all appeared to Trillian to begenuinely stupid, but she could no longer be bothered to argue about.

Far back in the mists of ancient time, in the great and glorious days of theformer Galactic Empire, life was wild, rich and largely tax free.Mighty starships plied their way between exotic suns, seeking adventure andreward among the furthest reaches of Galactic space.  In those days, spiritswere brave, the stakes were high, men were real men, women were real womenand small furry creatures from Alpha Centauri were real small furry creaturesfrom Alpha Centauri.  And all dared to brave unknown terrors, to do mightydeeds, to boldly split infinitives that no man had split before -- and thuswas the Empire forged.

A man who knows ajob sees so much more to be done than he has done, that he is always pressingforward and never gives up an instant of thought to how good and how efficienthe is.  Thinking always ahead, thinking always of trying to do more, brings astate of mind in which nothing is impossible.
