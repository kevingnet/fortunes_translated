He is amazed that a chicken isrunning at forty m.p.h.  So he speeds up to forty-five, fifty, then sixtym.p.h.  The chicken keeps right up with him the whole way, then suddenlytakes off and disappears into the distance.	The man pulls into the farmyard and says to the farmer, "You know,the strangest thing just happened to me; I was driving along at at leastsixty miles an hour and a chicken passed me like I was standing still!"	"Yeah," the farmer replies, "that chicken was ours.  You see, there'sme, and there's Ma, and there's our son Billy.  Whenever we had chicken fordinner, we would all want a drumstick, so we'd have to kill two chickens.So we decided to try and breed a three-legged chicken so each of us couldhave a drumstick."

"That's quite a pig you have there, sir" said the salesman.	"Sure is, son," the farmer replied.

"And that's not the only thing.  Last fall I was cuttin' wood up onthe north forty when a tree fell on me.  Pinned me to the ground, it did.That pig run up and wiggled underneath that tree and lifted it off of me.Saved my life."	"Fantastic!  the salesman said.

But the greatest Electrical Pioneer of them all was Thomas Edison, who was abrilliant inventor despite the fact that he had little formal education andlived in New Jersey.  Edison's first major invention in 1877, was thephonograph, which could soon be found in thousands of American homes, whereit basically sat until 1923, when the record was invented.  But Edison'sgreatest achievement came in 1879, when he invented the electric company.Edison's design was a brilliant adaptation of the simple electrical circuit:the electric company sends electricity through a wire to a customer, thenimmediately gets the electricity back through another wire, then (this isthe brilliant part) sends it right back to the customer again.This means that an electric company can sell a customer the same batch ofelectricity thousands of times a day and never get caught, since very fewcustomers take the time to examine their electricity closely. In fact thelast year any new electricity was generated in the United States was 1937;the electric companies have been merely re-selling it ever since, which iswhy they have so much free time to apply for rate increases.

	By the middle 1880's, practically all the roads except those inthe South, were of the present standard gauge.  The southern roads werestill five feet between rails.	It was decided to change the gauge of all southern roads to standard,in one day.  This remarkable piece of work was carried out on a Sunday in Mayof 1886.  For weeks beforehand, shops had been busy pressing wheels in on theaxles to the new and narrower gauge, to have a supply of rolling stock whichcould run on the new track as soon as it was ready.  Finally, on the day set,great numbers of gangs of track layers went to work at dawn.  Everywhere onerail was loosened, moved in three and one-half inches, and spiked down in itsnew position.  By dark, trains from anywhere in the United States could operateover the tracks in the South, and a free interchange of freight cars everywherewas possible.

	If you're like most homeowners, you're afraid that many repairsaround your home are too difficult to tackle.  So, when your furnaceexplodes, you call in a so-called professional to fix it.  The"professional" arrives in a truck with lettering on the sides and deposits alarge quantity of tools and two assistants who spend the better part of theweek in your basement whacking objects at random with heavy wrenches, afterwhich the "professional" returns and gives you a bill for slightly moremoney than it would cost you to run a successful campaign for the U.S.Senate.	And that's why you've decided to start doing things yourself. Youfigure, "If those guys can fix my furnace, then so can I.  How difficult canit be?"	Very difficult.  In fact, most home projects are impossible, whichis why you should do them yourself.  There is no point in paying otherpeople to screw things up when you can easily screw them up yourself for farless money.  This article can help you.

	NEW YORK-- Kraft Foods, Inc. announced today that its board ofdirectors unanimously rejected the $11 billion takeover bid by PhilipMorris and Co. A Kraft spokesman stated in a press conference that theoffer was rejected because the $90-per-share bid did not reflect thetrue value of the company.	Wall Street insiders, however, tell quite a different story.Apparently, the Kraft board of directors had all but signed the takeoveragreement when they learned of Philip Morris' marketing plans for one oftheir major Middle East subsidiaries.  To a person, the board voted toreject the bid when they discovered that the tobacco giant intended toreorganize Israeli Cheddar, Ltd., and name the new company Cheeses of Nazareth.

None of our men are "experts."  We have most unfortunately found it necessaryto get rid of a man as soon as he thinks himself an expert -- because no oneever considers himself expert if he really knows his job.  A man who knows ajob sees so much more to be done than he has done, that he is always pressingforward and never gives up an instant of thought to how good and how efficienthe is.  Thinking always ahead, thinking always of trying to do more, brings astate of mind in which nothing is impossible. The moment one gets into the"expert" state of mind a great number of things become impossible.

	Now, you might ask, "How do I get one of those complete home toolsets for under $4?" An excellent question.	Go to one of those really cheap discount stores where they sellplastic furniture in colors visible from the planet Neptune and where theyhave a food section specializing in cardboard cartons full of Raisinets andmalted milk balls manufactured during the Nixon administration.  In eitherthe hardware or housewares department, you'll find an item imported from anobscure Oriental country and described as "Nine Tools in One", consisting ofa little handle with interchangeable ends representing inscrutable Orientalnotions of tools that Americans might use around the home.  Buy it.	This is the kind of tool set professionals use.  Not only is itinexpensive, but it also has a great safety feature not found in theso-called quality tools sets: The handle will actually break right off ifyou accidentally hit yourself or anything else, or expose it to directsunlight.

Well, the next day the same thing happened -- Big John got onagain, made a show of refusing to pay, and sat down.  And the next day, and theone after that, and so forth.  This grated on the bus driver, who startedlosing sleep over the way Big John was taking advantage of him.  Finally hecould stand it no longer. He signed up for bodybuilding courses, karate, judo,and all that good stuff.  By the end of the summer, he had become quite strong;what's more, he felt really good about himself.	So on the next Monday, when Big John once again got on the busand said "Big John doesn't pay!," the driver stood up, glared back at thepassenger, and screamed, "And why not?"	With a surprised look on his face, Big John replied, "Big John has abus pass."

One of your most ancient writers, a historian named Herodotus, tells of athief who was to be executed.  As he was taken away he made a bargain withthe king: in one year he would teach the king's favorite horse to singhymns.  The other prisoners watched the thief singing to the horse andlaughed.  "You will not succeed," they told him.  "No one can."	To which the thief replied, "I have a year, and who knows what mighthappen in that time.  The king might die.  The horse might die.  I might die.And perhaps the horse will learn to sing.

One promising concept that I came up with right away was that you couldmanufacture personal air bags, then get a law passed requiring that they beinstalled on congressmen to keep them from taking trips.  Let's say yourcongressman was trying to travel to Paris to do a fact-finding study on howthe French government handles diseases transmitted by sherbet.  Just when hegot to the plane, his mandatory air bag, strapped around his waist, wouldinflate -- FWWAAAAAAPPPP -- thus rendering him too large to fit through theplane door.  It could also be rigged to inflate whenever the congressmanproposed a law.  ("Mr. Speaker, people ask me, why should October bedesignated as Cuticle Inspection Month?  And I answer that FWWAAAAAAPPPP.")This would save millions of dollars, so I have no doubt that the publicwould violently support a law requiring airbags on congressmen.  The problemis that your potential market is very small: there are only around 500members of Congress, and some of them, such as House Speaker "Tip" O'Neil,are already too large to fit on normal aircraft.

	Plumbing is one of the easier of do-it-yourself activities,requiring only a few simple tools and a willingness to stick your arm into aclogged toilet.  In fact, you can solve many home plumbing problems, such asannoying faucet drip, merely by turning up the radio.  But before we getinto specific techniques, let's look at how plumbing works.	A plumbing system is very much like your electrical system, exceptthat instead of electricity, it has water, and instead of wires, it haspipes, and instead of radios and waffle irons, it has faucets and toilets.So the truth is that your plumbing systems is nothing at all like yourelectrical system, which is good, because electricity can kill you.

Shaken, theyoung man opened the first envelope, which said, "Blame it all on me."	The next day, he held a press conference and did just that.  Thecrisis passed.	Six months later, sales dropped precipitously.  The beleagueredmanager opened the second envelope.  It said, "Reorganize."

The Worst Car Hire Service	When David Schwartz left university in 1972, he set up Rent-a-wreckas a joke.  Being a natural prankster, he acquired a fleet of beat-upshabby, wreckages waiting for the scrap heap in California.	He put on a cap and looked forward to watching people's faces as heconducted them round the choice of bumperless, dented junkmobiles.	To his lasting surprise there was an insatiable demand for them andhe now has 26 thriving branches all over America.  "People like drivinground in the worst cars available," he said.  Of course they do.	"If a driver damages the side of a car and is honest enough toadmit it, I tell him, `Forget it'.  If they bring a car back late weoverlook it.  If they've had a crash and it doesn't involve another vehiclewe might overlook that too."	"Where's the ashtray?" asked one Los Angeles wife, as she settledinto the ripped interior.  "Honey," said her husband, "the whole car's theash tray."

	They are fools that think that wealth or women or strong drink or evendrugs can buy the most in effort out of the soul of a man.  These things offerpale pleasures compared to that which is greatest of them all, that task whichdemands from him more than his utmost strength, that absorbs him, bone andsinew and brain and hope and fear and dreams -- and still calls for more.	They are fools that think otherwise.  No great effort was ever bought.No painting, no music, no poem, no cathedral in stone, no church, no state wasever raised into being for payment of any kind.  No parthenon, no Thermopylaewas ever built or fought for pay or glory; no Bukhara sacked, or China groundbeneath Mongol heel, for loot or power alone.  The payment for doing thesethings was itself the doing of them.	To wield oneself -- to use oneself as a tool in one's own hand -- andso to make or break that which no one else can build or ruin -- THAT is thegreatest pleasure known to man!  To one who has felt the chisel in his handand set free the angel prisoned in the marble block, or to one who has feltsword in hand and set homeless the soul that a moment before lived in the bodyof his mortal enemy -- to those both come alike the taste of that rare foodspread only for demons or for gods."

This is an especially good time for you vacationers who plan to fly, becausethe Reagan administration, as part of the same policy under which itrecently sold Yellowstone National Park to Wayne Newton, has "deregulated"the airline industry.  What this means for you, the consumer, is that theairlines are no longer required to follow any rules whatsoever.  They canshow snuff movies.  They can charge for oxygen.  They can hire pilots rightout of Vending Machine Refill Person School.  They can conserve fuel byejecting husky passengers over water.  They can ram competing planes inmid-air.  These innovations have resulted in tremendous cost savings whichhave been passed along to you, the consumer, in the form of flights withamazingly low fares, such as $29.  Of course, certain restrictions do apply,the main one being that all these flights take you to Newark, and you mustpay thousands of dollars if you want to fly back out.

Very few things actually get manufactured these days, because in aninfinitely large Universe, such as the one in which we live, most things onecould possibly imagine, and a lot of things one would rather not, growsomewhere.  A forest was discovered recently in which most of the trees grewratchet screwdrivers as fruit.  The life cycle of the ratchet screwdriver isquite interesting.  Once picked it needs a dark dusty drawer in which it canlie undisturbed for years.  Then one night it suddenly hatches, discards itsouter skin that crumbles into dust, and emerges as a totally unidentifiablelittle metal object with flanges at both ends and a sort of ridge and a holefor a screw.  This, when found, will get thrown away.  No one knows what thescrewdriver is supposed to gain from this.  Nature, in her infinite wisdom,is presumably working on it.

The population of this country is 200 million.  84 million are over60 years of age, which leaves 116 million to do the work.  People under 20years of age total 75 million, which leaves 41 million to do the work.	There are 22 million who are employed by the government, which leaves19 million to do the work.  Four million are in the Armed Services, whichleaves 15 million to do the work.  Deduct 14,800,000, the number in the stateand city offices, leaving 200,000 to do the work.  There are 188,000 inhospitals, insane asylums, etc., so that leaves 12,000 to do the work.	Now it may interest you to know that there are 11,998 people in jail,so that leaves just 2 people to carry the load. That is you and me, andbrother, I'm getting tired of doing everything myself!
