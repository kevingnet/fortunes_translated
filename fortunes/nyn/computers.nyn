A certain monk had a habit of pestering the Grand Tortue (the only one whohad ever reached the Enlightenment 'Yond Enlightenment), by asking whethervarious objects had Buddha-nature or not.  To such a question Tortueinvariably sat silent.  The monk had already asked about a bean, a lake,and a moonlit night.  One day he brought to Tortue a piece of string, andasked the same question.  In reply, the Grand Tortue grasped the loopbetween his feet and, with a few simple manipulations, created a complexstring which he proferred wordlessly to the monk.  At that moment, the monkwas enlightened.From then on, the monk did not bother Tortue.  Instead, he made string afterstring by Tortue's method; and he passed the method on to his own disciples,who passed it on to theirs.

	A manager asked a programmer how long it would take him to finish theprogram on which he was working.  "I will be finished tomorrow," the programmerpromptly replied.	"I think you are being unrealistic," said the manager. "Truthfully,how long will it take?"	The programmer thought for a moment.  "I have some features that I wishto add.  This will take at least two weeks," he finally said.	"Even that is too much to expect," insisted the manager, "I will besatisfied if you simply tell me when the program is complete."

	A program should be light and agile, its subroutines connected like astrings of pearls.  The spirit and intent of the program should be retainedthroughout.  There should be neither too little nor too much, neither needlessloops nor useless variables, neither lack of structure nor overwhelmingrigidity.	A program should follow the 'Law of Least Astonishment'.  What is thislaw?  It is simply that the program should always respond to the user in theway that astonishes him least.	A program, no matter how complex, should act as a single unit.  Theprogram should be directed by the logic within rather than by outwardappearances.	If the program fails in these requirements, it will be in a state ofdisorder and confusion.  The only way to correct this is to rewrite theprogram.

===  ALL USERS PLEASE NOTE  ========================The garbage collector now works.  In addition a new, experimental garbagecollection algorithm has been installed.  With SI:%DSK-GC-QLX-BITS set to 17,(NOT the default) the old garbage collection algorithm remains in force; whenvirtual storage is filled, the machine cold boots itself.  With SI:%DSK-GC-QLX-BITS set to 23, the new garbage collector is enabled.  Unlike most garbagecollectors, the new gc starts its mark phase from the mind of the user, ratherthan from the obarray.  This allows the garbage collection of significantlymore Qs.  As the garbage collector runs, it may ask you something like "Do youremember what SI:RDTBL-TRANS does?", and if you can't give a reasonable answerin thirty seconds, the symbol becomes a candidate for GCing.  The variableSI:%GC-QLX-LUSER-TM governs how long the GC waits before timing out the user.

... an anecdote from IBM's Yorktown Heights Research Center.  When aprogrammer used his new computer terminal, all was fine when he was sittingdown, but he couldn't log in to the system when he was standing up.  Thatbehavior was 100 percent repeatable: he could always log in when sitting andnever when standing.Most of us just sit back and marvel at such a story; how could that terminalknow whether the poor guy was sitting or standing?  Good debuggers, though,know that there has to be a reason.  Electrical theories are the easiest tohypothesize: was there a loose wire under the carpet, or problems with staticelectricity?  But electrical problems are rarely consistently reproducible.An alert IBMer finally noticed that the problem was in the terminal's keyboard:the tops of two keys were switched.  When the programmer was seated he was atouch typist and the problem went unnoticed, but when he stood he was ledastray by hunting and pecking.

As in Protestant Europe, by contrast, where sects divided endlessly intosmaller competing sects and no church dominated any other, all is differentin the fragmented world of IBM.  That realm is now a chaos of conflictingnorms and standards that not even IBM can hope to control.  You can buy acomputer that works like an IBM machine but contains nothing made or sold byIBM itself.  Renegades from IBM constantly set up rival firms and establishstandards of their own.  When IBM recently abandoned some of its originalstandards and decreed new ones, many of its rivals declared a puritanallegiance to IBM's original faith, and denounced the company as a divisiveinnovator.  Still, the IBM world is united by its distrust of icons andimagery.  IBM's screens are designed for language, not pictures.  Gravenimages may be tolerated by the luxurious cults, but the true IBM faith relieson the austerity of the word.

The only difficulty is that the problem is NP complete and willtake thousands of years even with the latest optical biologic technologyavailable.  The best computer scientists sit down to think up some solution.In great dismay, one of the C.S. people tells her husband about it.  Thereis only one solution, he says.  Remember physics 103, Modern Physics, generalrelativity and all.  She replies, "What does that have to do with solvinga computer problem?"	"Remember the twin paradox?"	After a few minutes, she says, "I could put the computer on a veryfast machine and the computer would have just a few minutes to calculate butthat is the exact opposite of what we want... Of course!  Leave thecomputer here, and accelerate the earth!"	The problem was so important that they did exactly that.

Always make sure followups go to all the groups.  In the rare eventthat you post a followup which contains something original, make sure youexpand the list of groups.

Each of these cults correspond to one of the two antagonists in the age ofReformation.  In the realm of the Apple Macintosh, as in Catholic Europe,worshipers peer devoutly into screens filled with "icons."  All is sound andimagery and Appledom.  Even words look like decorative filigrees in exotictypefaces.  The greatest icon of all, the inviolable Apple itself, stands inthe dominate position at the upper-left corner of the screen.  A centralcorporate headquarters decrees the form of all rites and practices.Infalliable doctrine issues from one executive officer whose selection occursin a sealed boardroom.  Should anyone in his curia question his powers, theoffender is excommunicated into outer darkness.  The expelled heretic foundsa new company, mutters obscurely of the coming age and the next computer,then disappears into silence, taking his stockholders with him.  The mothercompany forbids financial competition as sternly as it stifles ideologicalcompetition; if you want to use computer programs that conform to Apple'sorthodoxy, you must buy a computer made and sold by Apple itself.

Eudaemonic research proceeded with the casual mania peculiar to this part ofthe world.  Nude sunbathing on the back deck was combined with phone calls toAdvanced Kinetics in Costa Mesa, American Laser Systems in Goleta, AutomationIndustries in Danbury, Connecticut, Arenberg Ultrasonics in Jamaica Plain,Massachusetts, and Hewlett Packard in Sunnyvale, California, where NormanPackard's cousin, David, presided as chairman of the board. The trick was tomake these calls at noon, in the hope that out-to-lunch executives would returnthem at their own expense.  Eudaemonic Enterprises, for all they knew, might bea fast-growing computer company branching out of the Silicon Valley.  Sniffingthe possibility of high-volume sales, these executives little suspected thatthey were talking on the other end of the line to a naked physicist crazedover roulette.

Ever wondered about the origins of the term "bugs" as applied to computertechnology?  U.S. Navy Capt. Grace Murray Hopper has firsthand explanation.The 74-year-old captain, who is still on active duty, was a pioneer incomputer technology during World War II.  At the C.W. Post Center of LongIsland University, Hopper told a group of Long Island public school adminis-trators that the first computer "bug" was a real bug--a moth.  At Harvardone August night in 1945, Hopper and her associates were working on the"granddaddy" of modern computers, the Mark I.  "Things were going badly;there was something wrong in one of the circuits of the long glass-enclosedcomputer," she said.  "Finally, someone located the trouble spot and, usingordinary tweezers, removed the problem, a two-inch moth.  From then on, whenanything went wrong with a computer, we said it had bugs in it."  Hoppersaid that when the veracity of her story was questioned recently, "I referredthem to my 1945 log book, now in the collection of the Naval Surface WeaponsCenter, and they found the remains of that moth taped to the page inquestion."		[actually, the term "bug" had even earlier usage in		regard to problems with radio hardware.  Ed.]

Then delete their name and addyours to the bottom of the list.Don't break the chain!  Make the copy within 48 hours.  Gerald R. of SanDiego failed to send out his ten copies and woke the next morning to findhis job description changed to "COBOL programmer."  Fred A. of New York sentout his ten copies and within a month had enough hardware and software tobuild a Cray dedicated to playing Zork.

For example, if \thinmskip = 3mu, this makes \thickmskip = 6mu.  But ifyou also want to use \skip12 for horizontal glue, whether in math mode ornot, the amount of skipping will be in points (e.g., 6pt).  The rule isthat glue in math mode varies with the size only when it is an \mskip;when moving between an mskip and ordinary skip, the conversion factor1mu=1pt is always used.  The meaning of '\mskip\skip12' and'\baselineskip=\the\thickmskip' should be clear.

It is a very humbling experience to make a multimillion-dollar mistake, butit is also very memorable.  I vividly recall the night we decided how toorganize the actual writing of external specifications for OS/360.  Themanager of architecture, the manager of control program implementation, andI were threshing out the plan, schedule, and division of responsibilities.	The architecture manager had 10 good men.  He asserted that theycould write the specifications and do it right.  It would take ten months,three more than the schedule allowed.	The control program manager had 150 men.  He asserted that theycould prepare the specifications, with the architecture team coordinating;it would be well-done and practical, and he could do it on schedule.Furthermore, if the architecture team did it, his 150 men would sit twiddlingtheir thumbs for ten months.	To this the architecture manager responded that if I gave the controlprogram team the responsibility, the result would not in fact be on time,but would also be three months late, and of much lower quality.  I did, andit was.  He was right on both counts.  Moreover, the lack of conceptualintegrity made the system far more costly to build and change, and I wouldestimate that it added a year to debugging time.

They hadgot the release date wrong by one day, and caused dozens of eager fansto connect to the sunsite computer at the wrong time.  ``No computer canhandle that kind of stress,'' explained the mourning sunsite manager,Erik Troan.  ``The spinning disks made the whole computer jump, andfinally it crashed through the floor to the basement.''  Luckily,repairs were swift and the computer was working again the same evening.``Thank God we were able to buy enough needles and thread and patch ittogether without major problems.''  The site has also installed a newthrottle on the network pipe, allowing at most four clients at the sametime, thus making a new crash less likely.  ``The book is now in ourIncoming folder'', says Troan, ``and you're all welcome to come and get it.''

	On the other hand, the TCP camp also has a phrase for OSI people.There are lots of phrases.  My favorite is `nitwit' -- and the rationaleis the Internet philosophy has always been you have extremely bright,non-partisan researchers look at a topic, do world-class research, doseveral competing implementations, have a bake-off, determine what worksbest, write it down and make that the standard.	The OSI view is entirely opposite.  You take written contributionsfrom a much larger community, you put the contributions in a room ofcommittee people with, quite honestly, vast political differences and allwith their own political axes to grind, and four years later you getsomething out, usually without it ever having been implemented once.	So the Internet perspective is implement it, make it work well,then write it down, whereas the OSI perspective is to agree on it, writeit down, circulate it a lot and now we'll see if anyone can implement itafter it's an international standard and every vendor in the world iscommitted to it.  One of those processes is backwards, and I don't thinkit takes a Lucasian professor of physics at Oxford to figure out which.

	One of the questions that comes up all the time is: How enthusiasticis our support for UNIX?	Unix was written on our machines and for our machines many years ago.Today, much of UNIX being done is done on our machines. Ten percent of ourVAXs are going for UNIX use.  UNIX is a simple language, easy to understand,easy to get started with. It's great for students, great for somewhat casualusers, and it's great for interchanging programs between different machines.And so, because of its popularity in these markets, we support it.  We havegood UNIX on VAX and good UNIX on PDP-11s.	It is our belief, however, that serious professional users will runout of things they can do with UNIX. They'll want a real system and will endup doing VMS when they get to be serious about programming.	With UNIX, if you're looking for something, you can easily and quicklycheck that small manual and find out that it's not there.  With VMS, no matterwhat you look for -- it's literally a five-foot shelf of documentation -- ifyou look long enough it's there.  That's the difference -- the beauty of UNIXis it's simple; and the beauty of VMS is that it's all there.[It's been argued that the beauty of UNIX is the same as the beauty of KenOlsen's brain.  Ed.]

Overall, the philosophy is to attack the availability problem from twocomplementary directions:  to reduce the number of software errors throughrigorous testing of running systems, and to reduce the effect of the remainingerrors by providing for recovery from them.  An interesting footnote to thisdesign is that now a system failure can usually be considered to be theresult of two program errors:  the first, in the program that started theproblem; the second, in the recovery routine that could not protect thesystem.

Excellent!" the Price exclaimed, "Your technique is faultless!"	"Technique?" said the programmer, turning from his terminal, "What Ifollow is the Tao -- beyond all technique.  When I first began to program Iwould see before me the whole program in one mass.  After three years I nolonger saw this mass.  Instead, I used subroutines.  But now I see nothing.My whole being exists in a formless void.  My senses are idle.  My spirit,free to work without a plan, follows its own instinct.  In short, my programwrites itself.  True, sometimes there are difficult problems.  I see themcoming, I slow down, I watch silently.  Then I change a single line of codeand the difficulties vanish like puffs of idle smoke.  I then compile theprogram.  I sit still and let the joy of the work fill my being.  I close myeyes for a moment and then log off."	Price Wang said, "Would that all of my programmers were as wise!"

	Risch's decision procedure for integration, not surprisingly,uses a recursion on the number and type of the extensions from therational functions needed to represent the integrand.  Although thealgorithm follows and critically depends upon the appropriate structureof the input, as in the case of multivariate factorization, we cannotclaim that the algorithm is a natural one.  In fact, the creator ofdifferential algebra, Ritt, committed suicide in the early 1950's,largely, it is claimed, because few paid attention to his work.  Probablyhe would have received more attention had he obtained the algorithm as well.

				SEMINAR ANNOUNCEMENTTitle:		Are Frogs Turing Compatible?Speaker:	Don "The Lion" Knuth				ABSTRACT	Several researchers at the University of Louisiana have been studyingthe computing power of various amphibians, frogs in particular.  The problemof frog computability has become a critical issue that ranges across all areasof computer science.  It has been shown that anything computable by an amphi-bian community in a fixed-size pond is computable by a frog in the same-sizepond -- that is to say, frogs are Pond-space complete.  We will show thatthere is a log-space, polywog-time reduction from any Turing machine programto a frog.  We will suggest these represent a proper subset of frog-computablefunctions.	This is not just a let's-see-how-far-those-frogs-can-jump seminar.This is only for hardcore amphibian-computation people and their colleagues.	Refreshments will be served.  Music will be played.

	Several students were asked to prove that all odd integers are prime.	The first student to try to do this was a math student.  "Hmmm...Well, 1 is prime, 3 is prime, 5 is prime, and by induction, we have that allthe odd integers are prime."	The second student to try was a man of physics who commented, "I'm notsure of the validity of your proof, but I think I'll try to prove it byexperiment."  He continues, "Well, 1 is prime, 3 is prime, 5 is prime, 7 isprime, 9 is...  uh, 9 is... uh, 9 is an experimental error, 11 is prime, 13is prime...  Well, it seems that you're right."	The third student to try it was the engineering student, who responded,"Well, to be honest, actually, I'm not sure of your answer either.  Let'ssee...  1 is prime, 3 is prime, 5 is prime, 7 is prime, 9 is... uh, 9 is...well, if you approximate, 9 is prime, 11 is prime, 13 is prime...  Well, itdoes seem right."	Not to be outdone, the computer science student comes along and says"Well, you two sort've got the right idea, but you'll end up taking too long!I've just whipped up a program to REALLY go and prove it."  He goes over tohis terminal and runs his program.  Reading the output on the screen he says,"1 is prime, 1 is prime, 1 is prime, 1 is prime..."

***** Special AI Seminar (abstract)It has been widely recognized that AI programs require expert knowledgein order to perform well in complex domains.  But knowledge alone is notsufficient for some applications; wisdom is needed as well.  Accordingly,we have developed a new approach to artificial intelligence which we call"wisdom engineering".  As a test of our ideas, we have written IMMANUEL, awisdom based system for the task domain of western philosophical thought.IMMANUEL was supplied initially with 200 wisdom units which contained wisdomabout such elementary concepts as mind, matter, being, nothingness, and soforth.  IMMANUEL was then allowed to run freely, guided by the heuristicrules contained in its heterarchically organized meta wisdom base.  IMMANUELsucceeded in rediscovering most of the important philosophical ideas developedin western culture over the course of the last 25 centuries, including thoseunderlying Plato's theory of government, Kant's metaphysics, Nietzsche's theoryof value, and Husserl's phenomenology.  In this seminar, we will describeIMMANUEL's achievements and internal architecture.  We will also brieflydiscuss our recent efforts to apply wisdom engineering to oil exploration.

There has also been some work to allow the interesting use of macro names.For example, if you wanted all of your "creat()" calls to include readpermissions for everyone, you could say	#define creat(file, mode)	creat(file, mode | 0444)	I would recommend against this kind of thing in general, since ithides the changed semantics of "creat()" in a macro, potentially far awayfrom its uses.	To allow this use of macros, the preprocessor uses a process thatis worth describing, if for no other reason than that we get to use one ofthe more amusing terms introduced into the C lexicon.  While a macro isbeing expanded, it is temporarily undefined, and any recurrence of the macroname is "painted blue" -- I kid you not, this is the official terminology-- so that in future scans of the text the macro will not be expandedrecursively.  (I do not know why the color blue was chosen; I'm sure itwas the result of a long debate, spread over several meetings.)

Beforewarned, for this trade show shall not escape unplundered."	This speech disturbed the guard greatly, because there were millionsof dollars of computer equipment inside, so he watched the man carefully.But the man merely wandered from booth to booth, humming quietly to himself.	When the man left, the guard took him aside and searched his clothes,but nothing was to be found.	On the next day of the trade show, the man returned and chided theguard saying: "I escaped with a vast booty yesterday, but today will be evenbetter."  So the guard watched him ever more closely, but to no avail.	On the final day of the trade show, the guard could restrain hiscuriosity no longer. "Sir Thief," he said, "I am so perplexed, I cannot livein peace.  Please enlighten me.  What is it that you are stealing?"	The man smiled.  "I am stealing ideas," he said.

"An operating system," replied the programmer.	The warlord uttered an exclamation of disbelief.  "Surely anaccounting package is trivial next to the complexity of an operatingsystem," he said.	"Not so," said the programmer, "when designing an accounting package,the programmer operates as a mediator between people having different ideas:how it must operate, how its reports must appear, and how it must conform tothe tax laws.  By contrast, an operating system is not limited my outsideappearances.  When designing an operating system, the programmer seeks thesimplest harmony between machine and ideas.  This is why an operating systemis easier to design."	The warlord of Wu nodded and smiled.  "That is all good and well, butwhich is easier to debug?"	The programmer made no reply.

Its disk drives lie end-to-end like a great oceanof machinery.  The software is a multi-faceted as a diamond and as convolutedas a primeval jungle.

				UNIX TrixFor those of you in the reseller business, here is a helpful tip that willsave your support staff a few hours of precious time.  Before you send yournext machine out to an untrained client, change the permissions on /etc/passwdto 666 and make sure there is a copy somewhere on the disk.  Now when theyforget the root password, you can easily login as an ordinary user and correctthe damage.  Having a bootable tape (for larger machines) is not a bad ideaeither.  If you need some help, give us a call.

Von Neumann was the subject of many dotty professor stories.

One time one of his students tried to get more helpfulinformation by asking if there was another way to solve the problem.  VonNeumann looked blank for a moment, thought, and then answered, "Yes.".

WARNING!!!This machine is subject to breakdowns during periods of critical need.A special circuit in the machine called "critical detector" senses theoperator's emotional state in terms of how desperate he/she is to use themachine.  The "critical detector" then creates a malfunction proportionalto the desperation of the operator.  Threatening the machine with violenceonly aggravates the situation.  Likewise, attempts to use another machinemay cause it to malfunction.  They belong to the same union.  Keep cooland say nice things to the machine.

"We invented a new protocol and called it Kermit, after Kermit the Frog,star of "The Muppet Show." [3][3]  Why?  Mostly because there was a Muppets calendar on the wall when wewere trying to think of a name, and Kermit is a pleasant, unassuming sort ofcharacter.  But since we weren't sure whether it was OK to name our protocolafter this popular television and movie star, we pretended that KERMIT was anacronym; unfortunately, we could never find a good set of words to go with theletters, as readers of some of our early source code can attest.  Later, whilelooking through a name book for his forthcoming baby, Bill Catchings noticedthat "Kermit" was a Celtic word for "free", which is what all Kermit programsshould be, and words to this effect replaced the strained acronyms in oursource code (Bill's baby turned out to be a girl, so he had to name her Beckyinstead).  When BYTE Magazine was preparing our 1984 Kermit article forpublication, they suggested we contact Henson Associates Inc. for permissionto say that we did indeed name the protocol after Kermit the Frog.  Permissionwas kindly granted, and now the real story can be told.  I resisted thetemptation, however, to call the present work "Kermit the Book."

Welcome to UNIX!  Enjoy your session!  Have a great time!  Note theuse of exclamation points!  They are a very effective method fordemonstrating excitement, and can also spice up an otherwise plain-lookingsentence!  However, there are drawbacks!  Too much unnecessary exclaimingcan lead to a reduction in the effect that an exclamation point has onthe reader!  For example, the sentence	Jane went to the store to buy breadshould only be ended with an exclamation point if there is somethingsensational about her going to the store, for example, if Jane is acocker spaniel or if Jane is on a diet that doesn't allow bread or ifJane doesn't exist for some reason!  See how easy it is?!  Proper controlof exclamation points can add new meaning to your life!

Writers who use a computer swear to its liberating power in tones that bearwitness to the apocalyptic power of a new divinity.  Their conviction resultsfrom something deeper than mere gratitude for the computer's conveniences.Every new medium of writing brings about new intensities of religious beliefand new schisms among believers.  In the 16th century the printed book helpedmake possible the split between Catholics and Protestants.  In the 20thcentury this history of tragedy and triumph is repeating itself as a farce.Those who worship the Apple computer and those who put their faith in the IBMPC are equally convinced that the other camp is damned or deluded.  Each cultholds in contempt the rituals and the laws of the other.  Each thinks that itis itself the one hope for salvation.

One of the things I routinely tell people is that if it's in the news, don'tworry about it.  By definition, "news" means that it hardly ever happens.  If arisk is in the news, then it's probably not worth worrying about.  Whensomething is no longer reported -- automobile deaths, domestic violence -- whenit's so common that it's not news, then you should start worrying."

Innovation has nothing to do with how many R&D dollars you have. When Applecame up with the Mac, IBM was spending at least 100 times more on R&D. It's notabout money. It's about the people you have, how you're led, and how much youget it.                -- Steve Jobs (1955-2011)

At least for the people who send me mail about a new language that they'redesigning, the general advice is: do it to learn about how to write acompiler. Don't have any expectations that anyone will use it, unless you hookup with some sort of organization in a position to push it hard. It's alottery, and some can buy a lot of the tickets. There are plenty of beautifullanguages (more beautiful than C) that didn't catch on. But someone does winthe lottery, and doing a language at least teaches you something.    -- Dennis Ritchie (1941-2011), creator of the C programming language and of    UNIX
