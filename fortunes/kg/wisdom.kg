Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to betruly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to dogreat work is to love what you do. If you haven't found it yet, keep looking.Don't settle. As with all matters of the heart, you'll know when you find it.And, like any great relationship, it just gets better and better as the yearsroll on. So keep looking until you find it. Don't settle.                -- Steve Jobs (1955-2011)(1) Avoid fried meats which angry up the blood.(2) If your stomach antagonizes you, pacify it with cool thoughts.(3) Keep the juices flowing by jangling around gently as you move.(4) Go very lightly on the vices, such as carrying on in society, as	the social ramble ain't restful.(5) Avoid running at all times.(6) Don't look back, something might be gaining on you.

	Once there lived a village of creatures along the bottom of a greatcrystal river.  Each creature in its own manner clung tightly to the twigsand rocks of the river bottom, for clinging was their way of life, andresisting the current what each had learned from birth.  But one creaturesaid at last, "I trust that the current knows where it is going.  I shalllet go, and let it take me where it will.  Clinging, I shall die of boredom."	The other creatures laughed and said, "Fool!  Let go, and that currentyou worship will throw you tumbled and smashed across the rocks, and you willdie quicker than boredom!"	But the one heeded them not, and taking a breath did let go, and atonce was tumbled and smashed by the current across the rocks.  Yet, in time,as the creature refused to cling again, the current lifted him free from thebottom, and he was bruised and hurt no more.	And the creatures downstream, to whom he was a stranger, cried, "Seea miracle!  A creature like ourselves, yet he flies!  See the Messiah, cometo save us all!"  And the one carried in the current said, "I am no moreMessiah than you.  The river delight to lift us free, if only we dare let go.Our true work is this voyage, this adventure.	But they cried the more, "Saviour!" all the while clinging to therocks, making legends of a Saviour.

Drawing a few deep even breaths, he entered a mental state practicedonly by Masters of the Universal Way of Zen.  In it his mind floated freely,able to rummage at will among the bits and pieces of data he had absorbed,undistracted by any outside disturbances.  Logical structures no longerinhibited him. Pre-conceptions, prejudices, ordinary human standards vanished.All things, those previously trivial as well as those once thought important,became absolutely equal by acquiring an absolute value, revealing relationshipsnot evident to ordinary vision.  Like beads strung on a string of their ownmeaning, each thing pointed to its own common ground of existence, shared byall.  Finally, each began to melt into each, staying itself while becomingall others.  And Mind no longer contemplated Problem, but became Problem,destroying Subject-Object by becoming them.	Time passed, unheeded.	Eventually, there was a tentative stirring, then a decisive one, andNakamura arose, a smile on his face and the light of laughter in his eyes.

You will strengthenyourself in this way."
