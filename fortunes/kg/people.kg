A green hunting cap squeezed the top of the fleshy balloon of a head.  Thegreen earflaps, full of large ears and uncut hair and the fine bristles thatgrew in the ears themselvse, stuck out on either side like turn signalsindicating two directions at once.  Full, pursed lips protruded beneath thebushy black moustache and, at their corners, sank into little folds filledwith disapproval and potato chip crumbs.  In the shadow under the green visorof the cap Ignatius J. Reilly's supercilious blue and yellow eyes looked downupon the other people waiting under the clock at the D. H. Holmes departmentstore, studying the crowd of people for signs of bad taste in dress.  Severalof the outfits, Ignatius noticed, were new enough and expensive enough to beproperly considered offenses against taste and decency.  Possession ofanything new or expensive only reflected a person's lack of theology andgeometry; it could even cast doubts upon one's soul.

But I find the old notions somehow appealing.  Not that I want to go backto them -- it is outrageous to have some outer authority tell you what isproper use and abuse of your own faculties, and it is ludicrous to holdreason higher than body or feeling.  Still there is something true andprofoundly sane about the belief that acts like murder or theft orassault violate the doer as well as the done to.  We might even, if wethought this way, have less crime.  The popular view of crime, as far asI can deduce it from the movies and television, is that it is a breakingof a rule by someone who thinks they can get away with that; implicitly,everyone would like to break the rule, but not everyone is arrogantenough to imagine they can get away with it.  It therefore becomes veryimportant for the rule upholders to bring such arrogance down.

There is no sense in asking anyone to read aloud anymore, as everbodyspeaks in such a low voice I can hardly hear them.	The material in dresses is so skimpy now, especially around the hipsand waist, that it is almost impossible to reach one's shoelaces.  And thesizes don't run the way they used to.  The 12's and 14's are so much smaller.	Even people are changing.  They are so much younger than they used tobe when I was their age.  On  the other hand people my age are so much olderthan I am.	I ran into an old classmate the other day and she has aged so muchthat she didn't recognize me.

	I made it a rule to forbear all direct contradictions to the sentimentsof others, and all positive assertion of my own.  I even forbade myself the useof every word or expression in the language that imported a fixed opinion, suchas "certainly", "undoubtedly", etc.   I adopted instead of them "I conceive","I apprehend", or "I imagine" a thing to be so or so; or "so it appears to meat present".	When another asserted something that I thought an error, I deniedmyself the pleasure of contradicting him abruptly, and of showing himimmediately some absurdity in his proposition.  In answering I began byobserving that in certain cases or circumstances his opinion would be right,but in the present case there appeared or semed to me some difference, etc.	I soon found the advantage of this change in my manner; theconversations I engaged in went on more pleasantly.  The modest way in which Iproposed my opinions procured them a readier reception and less contradiction.I had less mortification when I was found to be in the wrong, and I more easilyprevailed with others to give up their mistakes and join with me when Ihappened to be in the right.

Largest Number of Driving Test Failures	By April 1970 Mrs. Miriam Hargrave had failed her test thirty-ninetimes.  In the eight preceding years she had received two hundred andtwelve driving lessons at a cost of L300.  She set the new record whiledriving triumphantly through a set of red traffic lights in Wakefield,Yorkshire.  Disappointingly, she passed at the fortieth attempt (3 August1970) but eight years later she showed some of her old magic when she wasreported as saying that she still didn't like doing right-hand turns.

	Looking for a cool one after a long, dusty ride, the drifter strodeinto the saloon.  As he made his way through the crowd to the bar, a mangalloped through town screaming, "Big Mike's comin'!  Run fer yer lives!"	Suddenly, the saloon doors burst open.  An enormous man, standing overeight feet tall and weighing an easy 400 pounds, rode in on a bull, using arattlesnake for a whip.  Grabbing the drifter by the arm and throwing him overthe bar, the giant thundered, "Gimme a drink!"	The terrified man handed over a bottle of whiskey, which the manguzzled in one gulp and then smashed on the bar.  He then stood aghast asthe man stuffed the broken bottle in his mouth, munched broken glass andsmacked his lips with relish.	"Can I, ah, uh, get you another, sir?" the drifter stammered.	"Naw, I gotta git outa here, boy," the man grunted.  "Big Mike'sa-comin'."

Many mental processes admit of being roughly measured.  For instance,the degree to which people are bored, by counting the number of theirfidgets. I not infrequently tried this method at the meetings of theRoyal Geographical Society, for even there dull memoirs are occasionallyread.  [...]  The use of a watch attracts attention, so I reckon timeby the number of my breathings, of which there are 15 in a minute.  Theyare not counted mentally, but are punctuated by pressing with 15 fingerssuccessively.  The counting is reserved for the fidgets.  These observationsshould be confined to persons of middle age.  Children are rarely still,while elderly philosophers will sometimes remain rigid for minutes altogether.

He wasreknowned for being quite clever and quite clearly was so -- but not all thetime, which obviously worried him, hence the act.  He preferred people to bepuzzled rather than contemptuous.

Us who decides.Nobody else.  My vampire told you he'd be hurt if you didn't let him?  That'shis decision to be hurt, that's his choice.  What you do about it is yourdecision, your choice: give him blood; ignore him; tie him up; drive a stakethrough his heart.  If he doesn't want the holly stake, he's free to resist,in whatever way he wants.  It goes on and on, choices, choices."	"When you look at it that way..."	"Listen," he said, "it's important.

	What is involved in such [close] relationships is a form of emotionalchemistry, so far unexplained by any school of psychiatry I am aware of, thatconditions nothing so simple as a choice between the poles of attraction andrepulsion.  You can meet some people thirty, forty times down the years, andthey remain amiable bystanders, like the shore lights of towns that a sailorpasses at stated times but never calls at on the regular run.  Conversely,all considerations of sex aside, you can meet some other people once or twiceand they remain permanent influences on your life.	Everyone is aware of this discrepancy between the acquaintance seenas familiar wallpaper or instant friend.  The chemical action it entails isless worth analyzing than enjoying.

Young men are fitter to invent than to judge; fitter for execution than forcounsel; and fitter for new projects than for settled business.  For theexperience of age, in things that fall within the compass of it, directeththem; but in new things, abuseth them.  The errors of young men are the ruinof business; but the errors of aged men amount but to this, that more mighthave been done, or sooner.  Young men, in the conduct and management ofactions, embrace more than they can hold; stir more than they can quiet; flyto the end, without consideration of the means and degrees; pursue some fewprinciples which they have chanced upon absurdly; care not how they innovate,which draws unknown inconveniences; and, that which doubleth all errors, willnot acknowledge or retract them; like an unready horse, that will neither stopnor turn.  Men of age object too much, consult too long, adventure too little,repent too soon, and seldom drive business home to the full period, butcontent themselves with a mediocrity of success.  Certainly, it is good tocompound employments of both ... because the virtues of either age may correctthe defects of both.

Your Co-worker Could Be a Space Alien, Say Experts		...Here's How You Can TellMany Americans work side by side with space aliens who look human -- but youcan spot these visitors by looking for certain tip-offs, say experts. Theylisted 10 signs to watch for:    (3) Bizarre sense of humor.  Space aliens who don't understand	earthly humor may laugh during a company training film or tell	jokes that no one understands, said Steiger.    (6) Misuses everyday items.  "A space alien may use correction	fluid to paint its nails," said Steiger.    (8) Secretive about personal life-style and home.  "An alien won't	discuss details or talk about what it does at night or on weekends."   (10) Displays a change of mood or physical reaction when near certain	high-tech hardware.  "An alien may experience a mood change when	a microwave oven is turned on," said Steiger.The experts pointed out that a co-worker would have to display most if notall of these traits before you can positively identify him as a space alien.

	Youth is not a time of life, it is a state of mind; it is a temper ofthe will, a quality of the imagination, a vigor of the emotions, a predominanceof courage over timidity, of the appetite for adventure over love of ease.	Nobody grows old by merely living a number of years; people growold only by deserting their ideals.  Years wrinkle the skin, but to give upenthusiasm wrinkles the soul.  Worry, doubt, self-distrust, fear, and despair-- these are the long, long years that bow the head and turn the growing spiritback to dust.	Whether seventy or sixteen, there is in every being's heart the loveof wonder, the sweet amazement at the stars and the starlike things andthoughts, the undaunted challenge of events, the unfailing childlike appetitefor what next, and the joy and the game of life.	You are as young as your faith, as old as your doubt; as young as yourself-confidence, as old as your fear, as young as your hope, as old as yourdespair.	So long as your heart receives messages of beauty, cheer, courage,grandeur and power from the earth, from man, and from the Infinite, so longyou are young.

When you are in the middle of a story it isn't a story at all, butonly a confusion; a dark roaring, a blindness, a wreckage of shatteredglass and splintered wood, like a house in a whirlwind, or else a boatcrushed by the icebergs or swept over the rapids, and all aboardpowerless to stop it.  It's only afterwards that it becomes anythinglike a story at all.  When you are telling it, to yourself or tosomeone else.
